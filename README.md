 # üé¨ About

A service designed to seamlessly integrate your Asana tasks with Airtable, eliminating the need for manual copying. This service streamlines the synchronization of task data between the two platforms.

Built on the Node.js framework, this integration orchestrates a seamless connection between Asana and Airtable. The core function revolves around automatic data transfer: whenever a new task is generated in Asana, it is seamlessly copied to Airtable. The newly created Asana task is mirrored as a fresh entry within the "Task-Saver" table in Airtable. This table is meticulously structured to include essential columns:

- Task ID
- Name
- Assignee
- Due Date
- Description

This seamless coordination hinges on the activation of webhooks. The service promptly responds to specific webhook actions triggered by Asana, including **added**, **changed**, and **deleted** Additionally, the service is fortified to manage intricate scenarios like task editing, and even instances where data is deleted in Airtable. For instance, if a change action is detected in Airtable after a data deletion, the service intelligently reinserts the data into the table.

These functionalities collectively ensure a smooth and dependable integration between Asana and Airtable, empowering you to maintain accurate and up-to-date task records effortlessly.
